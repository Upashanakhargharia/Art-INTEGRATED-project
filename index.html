                            <p>"The Palace, overlooking the picturesque village from which
                                 it takes its name, is one of the finest examples of mixed
                                  Rajput and Mughal styles. Imposing and inviting in equal
                                   measure, it has a commanding façade that gives way to an 
                                   intricate network of passageways, stairways, courtyards
                                    and exquisitely decorated rooms that contain glorious 
                                    frescoes and a sandstone serenity thats the final word
                                     in understated class. Unlike other forts and palaces in Rajasthan that have become
                                 muted and weary tourist attractions, Samode remains a vibrant
                                 , living place, providing the guest with the opportunity to really
                                  experience such an atmosphere much closer to the original grandeur,
                                   free to walk within halls and explore rooms such as the incredible
                                    sheesh mahal at their own pace and lesiure.
                                 Once the almost exclusive preserve of foreign tourists, Samode has recently
                                seen a sharp rise in domestic guests, and this is reflected in the lavish
                                 wedding parties that are now de rigueur, and the new fine dining resturant
                                  that serves modern Indian cuisine.
                                 There are still all the traditional activities that one might expect on offercamel
                                 and horse rides in the desert, sunrise ballooning, cooking classes in the local 
                                 village, a visit to the nearby Bagh yet the true majesty of your stay can be
                                  found in the simple pleasures: a sunset drink as the sandstone cools, a massage
                                   at the spa, a dip in one of the pools and a walk around the mazy grounds before 
                                   luxuriating in the bathtub or private jacuzzi in your room and finally falling
                                    to a blissful sleep. We cant recommend Samode Palace enough "</p>

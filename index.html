 <h2>Tripzuki Hotal, JAIPUR</h2>
<p>"The Palace, overlooking the picturesque village from which
it takes its name, is one of the finest examples of mixed
 Rajput and Mughal styles. Imposing and inviting in equal
 measure, it has a commanding façade that gives way to an
 intricate network of passageways, stairways, courtyards
 and exquisitely decorated rooms that contain glorious
frescoes and a sandstone serenity thats the final word
in understated class. Unlike other forts and palaces in Rajasthan
that have become
 muted and weary tourist attractions, Samode remains a vibrant
, living place, providing the guest with the opportunity
 experience such an atmosphere much closer to the original grandeur,
 free to walk within halls and explore rooms such as the incredible
 sheesh mahal at their own pace and lesiure.
 Once the almost exclusive preserve of foreign tourists, Samode has
 recently
 seen a sharp rise in domestic guests, and this is reflected in the
lavish
 wedding parties that are now de rigueur, and the new fine dining
 restural that serves modern Indian cuisine.
 There are still all the traditional activities that one might expect
on offercamel
 and horse rides in the desert, sunrise ballooning, cooking classes
 in the local
 village, a visit to the nearby Bagh yet the true majesty of your
 stay can be
 found in the simple pleasures: a sunset drink as the sandstone
 cools, a massage
 at the spa, a dip in one of the pools and a walk around the mazy
grounds before
luxuriating in the bathtub or private jacuzzi in your room and
finally falling
 to a blissful sleep. We cant recommend Samode Palace enough "</p>

 <h2>RAAS Jodhpur, JAIPUR</h2>
 <p>" Jodhpur and under the imposing stare of
 Mehrangarh Fort, sits RAAS. The site was
 formerly the home of the aristocratic Thakur
 family, and the original 18th-century haveli
 has been carefully renovated to produce
 the four old buildings of the hotel. The
 three new buildings are modern and
 contemporary in their use of space
 and light, and yet are grounded in
 tradition.
 Jodhpur's red sandstone unites the new with
 the old, with modern designs in its
 latticing and carving adding a fresh
dimension to the region's age-old stone
 carving industry. This seamless harmony
 between the old and the new, the modern
 and the traditional, extends to all
aspects of RAAS. Almost all of the
 rooms have magnificent views of
 Mehrangarh Fort from both the private
 terraces and from the cast iron
 bathtubs, and those that dont have
 their own private gardens and views
 over the old haveli and landscaped
 gardens of RAAS. The rooms are
 furnished with state of the art amenities

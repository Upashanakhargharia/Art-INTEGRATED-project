            </p><h2>The Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur</h2>
            <p>"JAIPUR, The Pink City which epitomizes the hotels
                 of high standards in Indian hospitality, which are 
                 rich in heritage and culture to reflect the Indian 
                 architecture and Interior designing. The beauty
                  discovered by the visitors helps them to fulfill
                   their desire to have an unforgettable experience 
                   with their loved ones. We are here revealing some 
                   points that are most importantly considered while 
                   booking a hotel room in Jaipur."</p>

            <p>In a city fabled for its palaces, The Oberoi Udaivilas can take its place with pride. With views over Lake Pichola to the spectacular City Palace, the hotel itself resembles a grand palace. Landscaped gardens and shady courtyards, decorative fountains and reflection pools, cool marble, ornate carving, inlay work and detailed interiors create a marvellous ambience of days gone by. Huge bedchambers with large private terraces, luxury suites with private swimming pools, marble bathrooms, walk-in closets, butler service and 24-hour in-room dining make you feel like royalty. The restaurants serve international and Indian cuisine including regional favourites. A gymnasium, two large swimming pools and a luxury spa offering a range of therapies, add to the ambience of total pampering. The facilities are particularly suited to meetings that might benefit from this exotic location.
